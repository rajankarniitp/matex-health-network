# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
DocMateX follows a modern React architecture with clear separation of concerns and scalable patterns.

## Core Principles

### 1. Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Components are built from small, reusable pieces
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Components compose together rather than extending
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose

### 2. State Management Strategy
```
Global State (React Context)
├── Theme (light/dark mode)
├── Notifications (toast messages)
└── User Authentication (when implemented)

Server State (React Query)
├── API data fetching
├── Caching strategies
└── Background updates

Local State (useState/useReducer)
├── Form inputs
├── UI interactions
└── Component-specific data
```

### 3. Data Flow
```
User Interaction → Component → Hook → Service → API → State Update → Re-render
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why React Context over Redux?
- Simpler setup for current complexity level
- Built-in to React, no additional dependencies
- Sufficient for current global state needs
- Can migrate to Redux/Zustand if complexity grows

### Why React Query?
- Excellent caching and synchronization
- Built-in loading/error states
- Background refetching
- Optimistic updates support

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Excellent responsive design support
- Easy to maintain and customize

## Security Architecture

### Client-Side Security
- CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- Input sanitization patterns
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Secure token storage patterns (localStorage with expiration)

### Planned Backend Security
- JWT token authentication
- Row Level Security (RLS) with Supabase
- API rate limiting
- Input validation on server

## Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting by routes
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Dynamic imports for third-party libraries

### Runtime Performance
- Memoization with React.memo
- useCallback/useMemo for expensive operations
- Virtualization for large lists (when needed)
- Image optimization and lazy loading

## Scalability Considerations

### Adding New Features
1. Create focused, single-purpose components
2. Use custom hooks for business logic
3. Add proper TypeScript types
4. Include error handling
5. Add to routing and navigation

### Performance Monitoring
- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Analytics for user behavior
- Custom performance metrics
- Load testing with K6

## Testing Strategy (Recommended)

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Hook behavior tests
- Utility function tests

### Integration Tests
- User interaction flows
- API integration tests
- Route navigation tests

### E2E Tests
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
